To start working with firebase download the firebase cli for your system - [firebase cli](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/)

After cloning the repo execute `firebase login` and follow the browser instructions

After that you are ready to perform all actions including `firebase deploy` - reference the firebase cli doc for more information

For local dev deployment use `firebase emulators:start`

Be careful when deploying to the cloud infinite loops can get very very costly. reviews are advised before deployment
